    <p>Traditional flour tortillas - homemade and much better than store bought. Do not substitute vegetable oil or shortening for the lard.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lard</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the flour, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl. Mix in the lard with your fingers until the flour resembles cornmeal. Add the water and mix until the dough comes together; place on a lightly floured surface and knead a few minutes until smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Use a well-floured rolling pin to roll a dough ball into a thin, round tortilla. Place into the hot skillet, and cook until bubbly and golden; flip and continue cooking until golden on the other side. Place the cooked tortilla in a tortilla warmer; continue rolling and cooking the remaining dough.</li>
